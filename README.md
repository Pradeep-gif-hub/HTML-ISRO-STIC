# 🚀 ISRO Project | RES-URSC-2024-007  
**Thermal Conductivity Measurement of Space-Grade Materials**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was carried out as part of an **ISRO-recognized academic research initiative** at the **Department of Instrumentation & Control Engineering (ICE), Dr. B. R. Ambedkar NIT Jalandhar**.

The objective of the project is to **experimentally determine the thermal conductivity of different forms of materials** (solid, gel, powder, and dynamic particulate matter) using **transient heat transfer methods**, with a **low-cost embedded system–based solution** proposed at the university level.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To study and compare **transient thermal measurement techniques**
- To determine **thermal conductivity** of:
  - Solid materials  
  - Gel materials  
  - Powder materials  
  - Dynamic particulate materials
- To design a **cost-effective experimental setup** using Arduino and sensors
- To validate experimental results with **theoretical models and plots**
- To propose a **scalable solution for space material testing**

## 🧪 Methods Used

### 1️⃣ Heat Pulse Method
A transient method where a **short heat pulse** is applied and the resulting **temperature response over time** is analyzed.

- Central probe acts as a **heater**
- Two outer probes act as **temperature sensors**
- Suitable for granular and powder materials
- Time-dependent temperature response is correlated with thermal conductivity

---

### 2️⃣ Double Sided Transient Plane Source (DSTPS) Method
A comparative transient technique used for **solid and symmetric samples**.

- Sensor placed between two identical sample halves
- Heat flows symmetrically in both directions
- High accuracy for solid materials
- Reduces boundary-related errors

## 🛠️ Proposed Experimental Setup

The proposed setup is designed to be **compact, economical, and reproducible**, making it suitable for academic and research environments.

### Components Used:
- **Arduino UNO** – data acquisition & control
- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)** – high-resolution signal conversion
- **Resistive Heater** – controlled heat input
- **Temperature Sensors** – precise temperature measurement
- **MATLAB** – data processing, curve fitting & slope extraction
